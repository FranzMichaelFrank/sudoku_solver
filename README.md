# CIFO Group Project - Solving Sudoku Puzzles With Genetic Algorithms

Group project at NOVA IMS, Lisbon, 2021. Master's degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics. Course: Computational Intelligence for Optimization.

The goal of this project is to develop a genetic algorithm that generates good solutions for a Sudoku puzzle, ideally solving the puzzle completely!

Note: In order to test the final genetic algorithm, download the repository and simply run the main.py file. The result will be a display of an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and its corresponding generated solution :)
